NYPD Data Comparison CompStat vs. Dangerous Moving Violation Enforcement

Hoping to take CompStat info by precinct for last year, compile it into monthly figures, and compare those numbers to monthly TrafficStat numbers for dangerous moving violations. The top three we will focus on are Failure to Yield, Speeding, and Red Light. Vision Zero initiative started January 2014, so that would be a good start date.

It would be a powerful advocacy tool to be able to show data and ask for more Vision Zero enforcement in precincts that have low numbers in both datasets.

In subsequent versions, NYPD staffing data will help complete the picture.

We are trying to counter the "we don't have enough manpower to focus on streets" argument many Commanding Officers mention for their lackluster dangerous moving violation enforcement.
